BTFI Data-Reduction Pipeline

Data-reduction pipeline created to deal with BTFI data. It is under development and the main goal of this file is put
together all the steps needed to get science data. The ideal is that the data-reduction process is modular, so each
module can be run individually and interaction mode or automatic mode must also be an option.

All the methods and classes and libraries and everything shall be written using Python and its standard packages. This
is a requirement. Another requirement is that each module/class/etc must be documented, easy to use and easy to install.

 Milestones:
 1. Data-quality
 1.1. Check folders for BIAS files.
 1.2. Check folders for DARK files.
 1.3. Check folders for FLAT files.
 1.4. Check folders for CALIBRATION files.
 1.5. Check folders for SCIENCE files.

 2. Choose between --reduce-it-all-- or --reduce-me-only--.
 2.1. Reduce it all: this option will reduce all the science data obtained in a single observing night.
 2.2. Reduce me only: this option will let the user to choose a single object to be reduced and data-reduction pipeline
                      will run according to this data.

 3. BIAS correction.
 3.1. Combine BIAS files using median and sigclip algorithm.
 3.2. Subtract BIAS files from all DARK, FLAT, CALIBRATION and SCIENCE files.
 3.3. Update DARK, FLAT, CALIBRATION and SCIENCE files header.

 4. DARK correction.
 4.1. Combine DARK files using median and sigclip algorithm.
 4.2. Subtract DARK files from FLAT, CALIBRATION and SCIENCE files which has same exposure times (EXPTIME).
 4.3. Update FLAT, CALIBRATION and SCIENCE files header.

 5. FLAT Corrections
 5.1. Choose between --correct-by-frame-- and --correct-it-all--
 ---- Correct by frame: all the FLAT corrections must be applied to files which has same configuration.
 ---- Correct it all: average all the FLAT obtained and same FLAT correction will be applied to all files.
 5.2. Combine images depending on the option above using median and sigclip.
 5.3. Divide combined images by their median value for normalization.
 5.4. Correct pixels that have values that are very far from 1.0 (0.9 - 1.1) substituting their value for 1.0.
 5.5. Apply FLAT correction to CALIBRATION and SCIENCE files dividing them by the properly corrected FLAT file.
 5.6. Update CALIBRATION and SCIENCE header.

 6. CALIBRATION
 6.1. Mount data-cubes using CALIBRATION files for each configuration.
 6.2. If data if a FPDATA, look for a frame that has rings and find its center.
      If not, ask used if a reference pixel will be used.
      Else, reference pixel will be the pixel [width/2, height/2]
 6.3. Get spectrum centered on the reference pixel and measure how many emission lines it has.
 6.4. Measure free-spectral-range in [channel] units and in instrument units:
      [bnv] if FPDATA
      [degrees] else.
 6.5. PHASEMAP FINDING: Isolate one line and measure how its center along the field choosing between:
      fastfit: get the displacement of this line in a given number of pixels along the field and fit the phase-map.
      measure: measure pixel-by-pixel the displacement of this line.
      A phase-map in [channels] and a phase-map in [bnv]/[degrees] have to be returned after this step.
 6.6. WAVELENGTH CALIBRATION: Use the spectrum extracted from the reference pixel and get line identification from user
      with:
      - line-position [bnv]/[degrees],
      - wavelength [angstroms] or [nanometers] or [km/s],
      - relative-order [--].
 6.6.1. Generate wavelength calibration header keywords to update CALIBRATION and SCIENCE files.

 7. SCIENCE
 7.1. Mount data-cubes using SCIENCE files for each configuration.
 7.2. Apply PHASEMAP-CORRECTION using PHASEMAP file (update header).
 7.3. Apply WAVELENGTH CALIBRATION using WCAL file.
